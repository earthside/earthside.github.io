                            <h2>Welcome to a Partnership with Nature</h2>
                        </div>
                        <p>At EarthSide Retreat, we believe in creating partnerships that are as enduring and beautiful
                            as the majestic vistas of Mahabaleshwar itself. Shared ownership at EarthSide Retreat isn't
                            just about having a stake in property; it's about embracing a lifestyle that intertwines
                            serenity with luxury, while being deeply rooted in nature's splendor.</p>
                        <h2>How Shared Ownership Works</h2>
                        <p>Imagine owning a piece of paradise where every visit feels like coming home, yet without the
                            hassle that typically comes with property ownership. At EarthSide Retreat, shared ownership
                            means you acquire a percentage of the owning company that holds the asset: our boutique
                            resort.</p>
                        <p>Investing in shared ownership is straightforward:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Choose Your Share</strong>: Depending on your lifestyle and investment capacity,
                                select the amount of share you wish to own in the company that is directly tied to the
                                physical asset of EarthSide Retreat.</li>
                            <li><strong>Legal Formalities</strong>: Complete the necessary legal documentation to
                                formalize your stake, guaranteeing your ownership percentage and your rights.</li>
                            <li><strong>Enjoy the Benefits</strong>: Revel in the investor privileges that come with
                                your share, including stay credits and a voice in the community of co-owners.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <h2>Benefits of Shared Ownership</h2>

                            <li><strong>Asset-Backed Investment</strong>: Your investment is tangible and solid, secured
                                by the land and the boutique resort that stands on it. As the value of the asset grows,
                                so does the worth of your investment.</li>
                            <li><strong>Hassle-Free Ownership</strong>: With shared ownership, leave the managerial
                                aspects to us. Expert teams maintain and run the resort to the highest standards,
                                ensuring that your investment is in capable hands while you relax.</li>
                            <li><strong>Exclusive Access</strong>: Enjoy exclusive stay periods at EarthSide Retreat,
                                experiencing firsthand the luxury and tranquility that you are a part owner of. Use your
                                stay credits to spend time in a place that feels like your own.</li>
                            <li><strong>Potential Earnings</strong>: As a shared owner, you may receive a share of the
                                profits from the resort's operations. Your investment can potentially pay dividends
                                beyond the serene experiences.</li>
                            <li><strong>Legacy Investment</strong>: Shared ownership at EarthSide Retreat isn't just for
                                the present; it's a legacy you can pass down to future generations, ensuring they have a
                                personal escape that values both luxury and nature's touch.</li>
                        </ol>

                                            accumulated room points, you can log in to our dedicated member portal on
                                            our website. Within the portal, you will find an easy-to-navigate booking
                                            interface where you can select your preferred dates, room type, and other
                                            preferences.

                                            For the Leisure Plan, you can use your room points to enjoy a stay at the

                                            For the Entrepreneur Plan, not only can you book a room for your own stay,
                                            but you also have the option to use your points to book rooms for guests
                                            (your customer). This flexibility allows you to share the luxury experience
                                            with friends, family, or even offer it as a special gift.

                                            while still providing some flexibility for those special occasions or
                                            unexpected changes in plans. The specific percentage and details regarding
                                            the carry-over limits can be found in our membership guidelines. Our aim is
                                            to strike the right balance between flexibility and active engagement for a
                                            rewarding experience at Earthside Retreats.</p>

                                            However, there are some potential costs that could arise that are not included in the grand total. These include:
                                            Upgrades to the resort. If the resort decides to make major upgrades, such as adding a new pool or spa, these costs would be passed on to the members.
                                            Major unforeseen events. If there is a major unforeseen event, such as a natural disaster, that the emergency fund cannot cover, the members may be required to contribute additional funds.
